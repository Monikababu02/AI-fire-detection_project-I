In contemporary infrastructure, fire outbreak detection and human occupancy management are 
important factors in increasing smart building emergency response and safety. Traditional methods 
of fire detection normally rely on infrared sensors or high-cost multi-sensor hardware systems, 
which are likely to be economically and logistically prohibitive for large-scale deployment, 
particularly in resource-scarce or large-scale environments. To address these constraints, this 
project introduces a completely software-based, smart surveillance system for concurrent fire and 
human presence detection through computer vision and real-time cloud integration without the 
requirement of specialized physical sensors. The foundation of this system utilizes the YOLOv5 
(You Only Look Once version 5) deep learning model, a very effective object detection framework 
renowned for its real-time processing and high accuracy. The model is custom-trained to recognize 
two main classes—person and fire—via frame-by-frame inspection of real-time video feed from 
a single surveillance camera.
